strengthening fusion weights amid high-frequency gait occurrences while
reducing drift in stationary positions. Furthermore, the system attains

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Wireless epidermal sensor networks have arisen as a revolutionary
technology for continuous human movement analysis, which permits
unobtrusive monitoring by means of skin-adherent inertial measurement
units (IMUs) \cite{RishaniElayanShubairKiourti2018}. These networks
commonly include accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers to gather
kinematic data, serving purposes from rehabilitation evaluation to
monitoring athletic performance
\cite{AlAmriNicholasButtonSparkesSheeranothers2018}. Traditional methods
for merging sensor data, including Kalman filters and complementary
filters, operate on IMU measurements by applying predefined mathematical
frameworks which presuppose uniform movement and consistent noise
properties \cite{CaronDuflosPomorskiVanheeghe2006}
\cite{McGinnisCainothers2014}. Nevertheless, these presumptions often
fail in intricate human motions where sensor behavior shows non-linear
trends and noise patterns that change over time.

The biological nervous system presents a different model for sensor
fusion, wherein spiking neural networks (SNNs) dynamically adjust their
synaptic weights in response to sensory input patterns. This
neuromorphic method shows notable resilience in handling erratic,
time-varying signals by employing mechanisms such as
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)
\cite{PandaAllredRamanathanothers2017}. Recent progress in flexible
neuromorphic electronics has rendered it possible to execute such
bio-inspired algorithms directly on epidermal platforms, thereby
obviating the necessity for energy-consuming data transfer to external
processors \cite{JangLeeBeakBiswasLeeothers2025}. Event-based processing
improves efficiency by initiating computations exclusively upon notable
alterations in sensor data, analogous to the sparse coding mechanisms
observed in biological sensory systems \cite{LiuXingTangMaPan2021}.

We present a new SNN framework dynamically optimizing IMU fusion
parameters via three biologically inspired mechanisms: (1) an adaptive
spike encoding layer converting raw sensor data into temporally precise
spike trains while reducing noise, (2) a plastic fusion core where
synaptic weights adjust based on movement complexity and sensor
reliability patterns, and (3) a hybrid CMOS-organic neuromorphic
processor performing these operations with milliwatt-level power
consumption. In contrast to traditional static fusion techniques, our
method dynamically adapts to motion patterns, for example, increasing
the weight of gyroscopic inputs during fast turns while prioritizing
accelerometer readings in stationary positions. This adaptability arises
from ongoing assessment of spiking patterns in diverse sensor
modalities, which establishes a mechanism of sensor reliability voting
by means of competitive synaptic plasticity.

The proposed system improves existing methodologies in four key areas.
First, the event-driven architecture reduces data bandwidth by 62\%
compared to conventional continuous sampling, achieved through
delta-modulated spike encoding. Second, the fusion weights
self-calibrate based on real-time analysis of movement complexity,
quantified through spiking frequency and inter-spike interval
statistics. Third, the execution merges silicon-based and flexible
organic transistors to uphold mechanical harmony with epidermal
substrates while enabling analog in-memory computation. Fourth, the
framework shows better resilience to typical IMU disturbances, including
magnetic interference and short-lived accelerations, and achieves higher
precision in orientation estimation than conventional filters during
intricate motions.

Current wireless epidermal systems are constrained by inherent
compromises among computational precision, power economy, and pliability
\cite{HuangLiuChengShinothers2014}. Although certain approaches attain
high accuracy by means of centralized processing
\cite{ChungKimLeeLeeXieIblerothers2019}, these methods typically
necessitate repeated data transfers that deplete battery power. Others
prioritize low-power operation but sacrifice adaptive capabilities
\cite{AmendolaOcchiuzziMiozziNappiAmatoothers2021}. Our work addresses
this gap by distributing neuromorphic processing across sensor nodes,
which permits local adaptation without continuous external intervention.
The architecture draws inspiration from recent developments in
brain-inspired multi-sensor fusion models \cite{Tilocca2024}, but
tailors them for the specific constraints of epidermal electronics
through sparse connectivity and mixed-signal circuit design.

The remainder of this paper systematically develops this bio-inspired
fusion framework. Section 2 reviews related work in epidermal sensor
networks and neuromorphic processing. Section 3 lays the theoretical
groundwork for sensor fusion with spiking neural networks and the traits
of epidermal inertial measurement units. Section 4 describes the
proposed adaptive architecture, which encompasses spike encoding,
plastic fusion, and hardware implementation. Section 5 evaluates
performance through benchtop experiments and human movement trials.
Section 6 explores wider ramifications and prospective avenues, with
conclusions presented in Section 7.

\section{Related Work}\label{related-work}

\subsection{Neuromorphic Computing for Sensor
Fusion}\label{neuromorphic-computing-for-sensor-fusion}

Recent progress in neuromorphic computing has shown encouraging outcomes
for merging data from multiple sensors, especially in scenarios
demanding immediate adjustment to changing conditions. A prominent
method applies Kalman filters in neural network structures
\cite{WangAlipouriHuang2020}, with conventional state estimation
equations being acquired via backpropagation. Although these approaches
exhibit greater resilience to non-linearities relative to traditional
filters, they continue to depend on computations with continuous values,
which result in substantial energy consumption. Alternative
architectures grounded in spiking neural networks have arisen as a more
biologically credible approach, handling sensory information via
discrete spike events that inherently correspond to the sparse structure
of human motion dynamics \cite{YuZahidTahaTaylorothers2022}. These
systems often employ spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules to
adjust inter-sensor weights dynamically, though existing implementations
typically focus on rigid rather than flexible substrates.

\subsection{Flexible Neuromorphic
Devices}\label{flexible-neuromorphic-devices}

Advances in flexible neuromorphic electronics have created novel
opportunities for wearable sensor networks that adapt to skin
morphology. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with PEDOT:PSS
channels have displayed notable potential for realizing synaptic
operations on flexible substrates \cite{ParkLeeKimSeoGoothers2020}.
These devices show adaptive memory properties akin to biological
synapses, which permits local learning without the need for frequent
data transfer to central processors. However, current flexible
neuromorphic systems often lack the precision required for inertial
measurement fusion, as their organic components introduce higher
variability than silicon-based counterparts. Mixed methods that unite
CMOS spike generators and adaptable OECT synapses aim to achieve a
compromise between efficiency and versatility
\cite{AzghadiLinaresBarrancoothers2016}, yet their implementation in
epidermal IMU systems has not been extensively investigated.

\subsection{Epidermal Sensor Networks for Movement
Analysis}\label{epidermal-sensor-networks-for-movement-analysis}

Wireless epidermal sensor networks have progressed from basic motion
monitors to advanced setups able to conduct comprehensive kinematic
assessments of the entire body \cite{JeongKwakSohnLeeLeeothers2021}.
Initial versions depended on standard microcontrollers for handling
data, which resulted in power limitations that restricted uninterrupted
functioning. Recent architectures include dedicated signal processing
components which transfer computational tasks from the central processor
\cite{LeeYoonLeeSeongLeeJangChoiothers2020}, yet continue to apply
static fusion algorithms. The KNOWME network established the viability
of employing multiple sensing modalities for analyzing movement
\cite{MitraEmkenLeeLiothers2012}, yet its dependence on conventional
machine learning methods necessitated large amounts of training data.
Amphibious epidermal networks propelled the discipline forward by making
continuous functioning possible in aqueous settings
\cite{HajiaghajaniRweiothers2023}, but their merging techniques were
still limited by rigid sensor weighting approaches.

\subsection{Event-Based Processing in Wearable
Systems}\label{event-based-processing-in-wearable-systems}

Biological sensory systems attain notable efficiency by handling
information solely when meaningful alterations arise in the
surroundings. This event-based paradigm has been adapted for wearable
sensors through delta modulation and adaptive sampling techniques
\cite{ZanoliPonzinaTeijeiroothers2023}. Certain approaches employ
spiking encoders to transform analog sensor data into spike trains,
which lowers the overhead of wireless transmission. However, these
systems typically lack the plasticity mechanisms needed for dynamic
sensor fusion, instead relying on predetermined encoding thresholds.
Combining event-driven processing with adaptive learning mechanisms
continues to pose unresolved difficulties, especially in contexts
demanding immediate reaction to movement variations.

The proposed framework distinguishes itself from existing approaches
through three key innovations. Initially, it merges noise-adaptive
spiking encoding with STDP-based fusion within a singular framework
explicitly designed for epidermal IMU networks. Second, the hybrid
CMOS-organic implementation attains both computational accuracy and
mechanical pliability, which resolves the constraints of purely organic
neuromorphic devices. Third, the system independently modifies fusion
parameters according to movement complexity, which removes the necessity
for manual calibration or large training datasets. This differs from
traditional fusion techniques employing static weighting schemes
irrespective of motion dynamics and exceeds current neuromorphic methods
by closely aligning with epidermal sensor limitations.

\section{Background on Neuromorphic Spiking Networks and
Epidermal IMU
Fusion}\label{background-on-neuromorphic-spiking-networks-and-epidermal-imu-fusion}

\subsection{Principles of Spiking Neural
Networks}\label{principles-of-spiking-neural-networks}

Spiking neural networks, as the third generation of neural network
models, more closely resemble biological neural processing by employing
discrete temporal events \cite{GrningBohte2014}. In contrast to
conventional artificial neurons that transmit continuous activation
values, SNNs exchange information through precisely timed spikes, with
data encoded in both the timing and frequency of these spikes. The leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model yields a computationally efficient
abstraction of this behavior, captured by the dynamics of the membrane
potential.

\[
\tau_m\frac{dV}{dt} = -(V - V_{rest}) + R_mI_{syn}
\tag{1}
\]

where \(\tau_m\) is the membrane time constant, \(V\) the membrane
potential, \(V_{rest}\) the resting potential, \(R_m\) the membrane
resistance, and \(I_{syn}\) the synaptic current. When \(V\) crosses a
threshold \(V_{th}\), the neuron emits a spike and resets to
\(V_{reset}\). This computation based on event-driven principles
supports sparse, energy-efficient processing, which corresponds to the
irregular nature of human movement patterns.

\subsection{Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity}\label{spike-timing-dependent-plasticity}

The adaptive properties of SNNs arise primarily from
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a learning mechanism observed
in biological systems which adjusts synaptic strengths depending on the
temporal relationship between pre- and post-synaptic spikes
\cite{CaporaleDan2008}. The weight change \(\Delta w\) follows an
asymmetric window function:

\[
\Delta w = 
\begin{cases}
A_+e^{-\Delta t/\tau_+} & \text{if } \Delta t > 0 \\
-A_-e^{\Delta t/\tau_-} & \text{if } \Delta t \leq 0
\end{cases}
\tag{2}
\]

where \(\Delta t = t_{post} - t_{pre}\), \(A_+/A_-\) determine the
maximum potentiation/depression, and \(\tau_+/ \tau_-\) control the
temporal window. This process grants spiking neural networks the
capacity to independently reinforce circuits that reliably forecast
critical occurrences and diminish unimportant links, a feature
especially beneficial for merging sensory data in changing settings.

\subsection{Epidermal IMU
Characteristics}\label{epidermal-imu-characteristics}

Epidermal IMUs display distinct sensing properties relative to
traditional rigid IMUs owing to their direct skin attachment and pliable
materials \cite{LeeHanKimKimLee2020}. Lacking rigid mounting results in
intricate motion artifacts when sensor movement deviates from the actual
bone kinematics. Moreover, the slender design constrains both power
storage and processing capabilities, which demands exceptionally
economical computation. These limitations drive the creation of
dedicated fusion algorithms capable of addressing the specified
challenges. 1. Compensate for skin-induced motion artifacts without
requiring precise anatomical alignment 2. Adapt to time-varying sensor
reliability caused by temporary detachment or environmental interference
3. Function under stringent energy constraints without compromising
real-time execution.

\subsection{Challenges in Conventional IMU
Fusion}\label{challenges-in-conventional-imu-fusion}

Conventional IMU fusion methods such as Kalman filters and complementary
filters exhibit three basic constraints in the context of epidermal
networks \cite{CorralesCandelasTorres2008}. Initially, they presume
constant disturbance properties, while epidermal sensors display
fluctuating disturbances caused by variations in skin-sensor contact
states. Secondly, their linear motion frameworks inadequately model
intricate human motions that include collisions and swift turns. Third,
they demand manual adjustment of process and measurement noise
parameters, which is difficult due to variations among users and sensor
placements. These issues become particularly pronounced in wireless
networks where sensors may temporarily lose alignment or experience
intermittent communication delays.

Applying neuromorphic computing principles to epidermal sensing
technologies indicates a viable approach to overcoming these obstacles.
SNNs naturally handle non-stationary signals through their adaptive
spiking thresholds and plastic synapses, while their event-driven
operation aligns with the power constraints of epidermal electronics.
Furthermore, the decentralized structure of neural processing aligns
effectively with the network architecture of wireless epidermal systems,
which supports localized adaptation in the absence of centralized
coordination.

\section{Bio-Inspired Adaptive SNN Fusion
Framework}\label{bio-inspired-adaptive-snn-fusion-framework}

The proposed framework creates a neuromorphic structure for dynamic
sensor fusion in wireless epidermal IMU networks by merging biological
principles with constraints of practical deployment. The system
processes multi-modal inertial data through three coordinated stages:
adaptive spike encoding, plasticity-driven fusion, and kinematic
reconstruction. Every phase includes distinct processes to tackle the
difficulties of epidermal sensing without compromising computational
performance. Figure 1 displays the full structure and shows how
conventional signal processing modules have been substituted with
bio-inspired spiking components.

\subsection{Event-Based Spiking Encoder with Adaptive Thresholding
Implementation}\label{event-based-spiking-encoder-with-adaptive-thresholding-implementation}

The spiking encoder transforms raw IMU signals into temporally precise
spike trains while suppressing measurement noise. We employ a modified
leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model with dynamic threshold adaptation,
where the spiking threshold \(V_{th}(t)\) evolves based on real-time
noise estimates. The membrane potential \(V_m\) of each encoder neuron
follows:

\[
\tau_m \frac{dV_m}{dt} = -V_m + \mathbf{w}_s \cdot \mathbf{s}(t) + \xi(t)
\tag{3}
\]

Here, \(\tau_m\) represents the membrane time constant (20 ms for
accelerometers, 50 ms for gyroscopes), \(\mathbf{w}_s\) denotes
sensor-specific input weights (normalized by sensor noise
characteristics), \(\mathbf{s}(t)\) contains the preprocessed IMU
readings (gravity-compensated acceleration and bias-corrected angular
velocity), and \(\xi(t)\) models environmental noise as a zero-mean
Gaussian process with variance \(\sigma^2(t)\).

The adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts \(V_{th}(t)\) according to
movement complexity and noise levels:

\[
V_{th}(t) = V_{th0} + \alpha \int_0^t e^{-\beta (t-\tau)} \|\mathbf{s}(\tau)\|_2 \, d\tau
\tag{4}
\]

where \(V_{th0}\) is the baseline threshold (0.8 for acceleration, 0.5
for rotation), \(\alpha\) controls sensitivity to motion intensity (0.05
for both modalities), and \(\beta\) determines the adaptation rate (0.1
Hz). The \(L_2\)-norm \(\|\mathbf{s}(\tau)\|_2\) captures overall
movement magnitude across sensor axes. This approach leads the encoder
to raise spiking thresholds when motion intensity is high (thereby
decreasing unnecessary spikes) while preserving responsiveness during
delicate movements.

For gyroscopic data, we introduce an additional angular acceleration
term \(\dot{\omega}(t)\) to enhance responsiveness to rapid rotations:

\[
V_{th}^{gyro}(t) = V_{th}(t) + \gamma |\dot{\omega}(t)|
\tag{5}
\]

where \(\gamma\) (0.02 s/rad) scales the angular acceleration
contribution. The encoder emits a spike when \(V_m(t) \geq V_{th}(t)\),
after which \(V_m\) resets to \(V_{reset} = -0.2V_{th0}\) and enters a 5
ms refractory period.

\subsection{Synaptic Plasticity - Driven Fusion Core
Details}\label{synaptic-plasticity---driven-fusion-core-details}

The fusion core applies dynamic weighting of IMU modalities by means of
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which permits continuous
adjustment to movement patterns and sensor dependability. Each synaptic
connection between encoder neurons and fusion neurons follows a
memristive STDP rule where weight updates depend on precise spike timing
correlations. The weight change \(\Delta w_{ij}\) between pre-synaptic
neuron \(i\) and post-synaptic neuron \(j\) is governed by:

\[
\Delta w_{ij} = \eta \sum_{t_i, t_j} \left[ A_+ e^{(t_i - t_j)/\tau_+} \Theta(t_j - t_i) - A_- e^{(t_j - t_i)/\tau_-} \Theta(t_i - t_j) \right] \tag{6}  
\]

Here, \(\eta\) scales the learning rate (0.01 for accelerometer inputs,
0.005 for gyroscopic inputs), \(A_+ = 0.2\) and \(A_- = 0.15\) determine
the maximum potentiation and depression, \(\tau_+ = 20 \, \text{ms}\)
and \(\tau_- = 30 \, \text{ms}\) define the temporal windows, and
\(\Theta\) denotes the Heaviside step function. The exponential terms
guarantee that causal spike pairs (t\_i \textless{} t\_j) reinforce the
synapse, whereas anti-causal pairs (t\_i \textgreater{} t\_j) diminish
it, reflecting biological learning mechanisms.

The fusion neurons employ conductance-based synapses where the synaptic
current \(I_{syn}\) integrates contributions from all connected
encoders:

\[
I_{syn}(t) = \sum_{i} G_{ij}(t)(V_{rev} - V_m(t)) \tag{7}  
\]

with \(G_{ij}(t) = w_{ij}(t)G_{max}\) representing the time-varying
synaptic conductance, \(G_{max} = 10 \, \mu\text{S}\) the maximum
conductance, and \(V_{rev} = 0 \, \text{mV}\) the reversal potential.
The weights \(w_{ij}\) are clipped to \([0, 1]\) to maintain stability,
with initial values set to 0.5 for accelerometer inputs and 0.3 for
gyroscopic inputs, reflecting their typical reliability in quasi-static
conditions.

To prevent uncontrolled weight drift, we introduce a homeostatic
regularization term that scales weight updates by the post-synaptic
firing rate \(r_j\):

\[
\Delta w_{ij} \leftarrow \Delta w_{ij} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{r_j}{r_{target}}\right) \tag{8}  
\]

where \(r_{target} = 15 \, \text{Hz}\) maintains balanced activity. This
prevents highly active fusion neurons from overwhelming the network,
thereby retaining responsiveness to sensor modalities that are less
active yet still informative.

The fusion core's output consists of spike trains from three populations
of neurons, each specialized for estimating roll, pitch, and yaw angles.
These populations receive inputs from all IMU axes but develop distinct
weight patterns through STDP: roll estimation neurons preferentially
strengthen connections from the \(y\)-axis accelerometer and \(x\)-axis
gyroscope, while pitch estimators favor \(x\)-axis accelerometer and
\(y\)-axis gyroscope inputs. This specialization emerges autonomously
from the temporal correlations in natural movements, where specific
sensor axes tend to lead others during particular rotations.

\subsection{Flexible Neuromorphic Unit with Hybrid Electronics
Setup}\label{flexible-neuromorphic-unit-with-hybrid-electronics-setup}

To attain epidermal compatibility without compromising computational
accuracy, we created a hybrid neuromorphic unit that merges silicon CMOS
spiking neurons with synaptic arrays based on organic electrochemical
transistors (OECTs). The CMOS component executes the LIF dynamics
(Equation 3) with a switched-capacitor circuit functioning at 0.6 V
supply voltage and requires 8.3 nJ per spike. The OECT array, fabricated
on a polyimide substrate with PEDOT:PSS channels, provides
reconfigurable synaptic connections where conductance \(G_{ij}\) follows
the STDP update rule (Equation 6). The OECT conductance is modeled as:

\[
G_{\text{OECT}} = \mu C^* \frac{W}{L} (V_G - V_T) \tag{9}  
\]

where \(\mu = 2.1 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{Vs}\) is the charge carrier
mobility, \(C^* = 1.8 \, \text{F/cm}^3\) the volumetric capacitance,
\(W = 20 \, \mu\text{m}\) and \(L = 5 \, \mu\text{m}\) the channel
dimensions, \(V_G\) the gate voltage, and \(V_T = -0.2 \, \text{V}\) the
threshold voltage. The gate voltage \(V_G\) encodes the synaptic weight
\(w_{ij}\) through a pulse-width modulated signal from the CMOS
controller, with 200 mV increments corresponding to 0.1 weight steps.

Electrical connections linking CMOS and OECT elements consist of
stretchable gold-polyimide serpentine wires, which preserve conductivity
under 30\% strain. Each trace has a resistance
\(R_{trace} = 120 \, \Omega\) per mm length, with capacitive coupling
\(C_{coupling} = 15 \, \text{fF}\) between adjacent lines. To minimize
crosstalk, we employ time-division multiplexing where spike events are
transmitted in 50 μs windows separated by 5 μs guard intervals.

The memristive crossbar array for analog weight storage utilizes
\(\text{Ag}/\text{SiOx}/\text{W}\) devices with 5 μm × 5 μm cells. Every
device displays non-linear behavior in its conductance.

\[
G_{mem} = G_{min} + (G_{max} - G_{min}) \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(V_{set} - V_0)}} \tag{10}  
\]

where \(G_{min} = 0.1 \, \mu\text{S}\), \(G_{max} = 10 \, \mu\text{S}\),
\(\alpha = 3 \, \text{V}^{-1}\), and \(V_0 = 0.7 \, \text{V}\). The set
voltage \(V_{set}\) is applied during STDP updates (Equation 6) to
modulate the conductance state. The crossbar attains 200 conductance
states with 0.2\% deviation, adequate for preserving fusion weight
accuracy.

Power management is controlled by a versatile thin-film lithium-ion
battery (2.4 mAh capacity) and an inductive charging coil functioning at
13.56 MHz. The complete neuromorphic unit measures 8 mm × 8 mm × 0.3 mm
and consumes 0.8 mW during continuous operation, with 72\% of power
allocated to the OECT synaptic array and 28\% to CMOS spike generation.

\subsection{Event - Driven Wireless Compression
Mechanism}\label{event---driven-wireless-compression-mechanism}

The event-driven compression module transforms the fused spike trains
into delta-modulated bitstreams optimized for low-power wireless
transmission. Each spike event is encoded as a tuple
\((t_k, n_k, p_k)\), where \(t_k\) represents the spike timing relative
to the last transmission (quantized to 1 ms resolution), \(n_k\)
identifies the neuron index (6 bits for 64 fusion neurons), and \(p_k\)
indicates polarity (1 bit for excitatory/inhibitory). The timing
compression follows an adaptive exponential-Golomb coding scheme:

\[
L(t_k) = \lfloor \log_2(t_k/ \tau_{base} + 1) \rfloor + 1 \tag{11}  
\]

where \(\tau_{base}\) is dynamically adjusted between 5-50 ms based on
the local spike rate \(\lambda(t) = \frac{N_{spikes}}{T_{window}}\),
with \(T_{window} = 100\) ms. This variable-length encoding reduces the
average timing overhead from 10 bits to 4.7 bits per spike during
typical movements.

The compression algorithm organizes spikes into 50 ms transmission
frames and implements run-length encoding (RLE) for successive silent
periods. Each frame header contains: 1. Base timestamp \(t_{frame}\) (16
bits)\\
2. Adaptive quantization step \(\Delta_q\) (4 bits)\\
3. Neuron activity bitmap (8 bytes for 64 neurons)

The payload contains compressed spike tuples, employing differential
encoding for neuron indices ( Δ n\_k = n\_k - n\_\{k-1\} ). For
movements producing sparse spikes (\textless10 spikes/frame), this
scheme achieves 62\% bandwidth reduction compared to continuous IMU
streaming at 100 Hz.

The wireless interface operates with a dual-protocol system, employing
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for regular metadata transmission at
500-millisecond intervals and a specialized 802.15.4 spike radio for
handling event-driven data bursts. The spike radio operates with on-off
keying at 250 kbps and has a 1.8 ms startup time, resulting in an energy
efficiency of 83 μJ/bit. During high-activity periods (\textgreater30
spikes/s), the system activates both radios for parallel transmission,
while relying solely on BLE during quiescent intervals (\textless5
spikes/s).

\subsection{SNN Decoder for Kinematic Reconstruction
Process}\label{snn-decoder-for-kinematic-reconstruction-process}

The kinematic reconstruction process transforms the fused spike patterns
into continuous orientation estimates through a three-layer spiking
convolutional network. The input layer contains 64 leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons which receive spike inputs from the
fusion core, with their membrane potentials following specific dynamics.

\[
\tau_d \frac{dV_d}{dt} = -V_d + I_{syn}(t) + \xi_d(t)
\tag{12}
\]

where \(\tau_d = 25\) ms is the decoder time constant, \(I_{syn}(t)\)
represents the synaptic current from Equation 7, and \(\xi_d(t)\) models
reconstruction noise as a colored noise process with power spectral
density \(S_{\xi}(f) = \frac{\sigma_d^2}{1 + (f/f_c)^2}\), where
\(\sigma_d = 0.1\) and \(f_c = 5\) Hz. The decoder neurons employ a
dynamic threshold \(V_{th}^d\) that adapts to local spike density:

\[
V_{th}^d(t) = V_{th0}^d \left(1 + \alpha_d \sum_{t_k} e^{-(t-t_k)/\tau_d}\right)
\tag{13}
\]

with \(V_{th0}^d = 0.6\), \(\alpha_d = 0.05\), and \(\tau_d = 50\) ms.
This adjustment avoids excessive prominence of high-frequency motion
elements while preserving responsiveness to slight directional
variations.

The hidden layer performs temporal convolution on the input spikes using
kernel functions \(K_m(t)\) that approximate biological receptive
fields:

\[
K_m(t) = A_m t e^{-t/\tau_m} \sin(2\pi f_m t + \phi_m)
\tag{14}
\]

where \(m\) indexes three motion axes (roll, pitch, yaw), with
parameters \(\tau_m = [15, 20, 25]\) ms, \(f_m = [12, 10, 8]\) Hz, and
\(\phi_m = [0, \pi/2, \pi]\) radians. The convolution output \(C_m(t)\)
for each axis is given by:

\[
C_m(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{64} w_{mi} \int_0^t S_i(\tau) K_m(t-\tau) d\tau
\tag{15}
\]

where \(S_i(\tau)\) represents the spike train from input neuron \(i\),
and \(w_{mi}\) are fixed weights initialized to match typical
sensor-axis contributions (e.g., \(y\)-axis accelerometer spikes
weighted more heavily for roll estimation).

The output layer converts the convolved signals into quaternion
representations \(\mathbf{q}(t) = [q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3]\) through a
spiking population code. Each quaternion component is encoded by 16
neurons with cosine-tuned firing rates:

\[
r_j^k(t) = r_{max} \left( \frac{1 + \cos(\theta_j - \theta_k(t))}{2} \right)^\gamma
\tag{16}
\]

where \(k\) indexes quaternion components, \(j\) denotes neuron index
within each population, \(\theta_j = \frac{2\pi j}{16}\),
\(\theta_k(t) = \arctan\left(\frac{C_{k2}(t)}{C_{k1}(t)}\right)\),
\(\gamma = 2.5\) controls tuning sharpness, and \(r_{max} = 50\) Hz. The
decoded quaternion is obtained by averaging the preferred angles
\(\theta_j\) weighted by spike counts over 20 ms windows:

\[
q_k(t) = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{16} n_j^k(t) \cos \theta_j}{\sum_{j=1}^{16} n_j^k(t)}, \quad k=1,2,3
\tag{17}
\]

\[
q_0(t) = \sqrt{1 - \sum_{k=1}^3 q_k^2(t)}
\tag{18}
\]

where \(n_j^k(t)\) counts spikes from neuron \(j\) in component \(k\)'s
population. This population coding method inherently resists noise while
keeping orientation errors below 1° RMS during intricate motions. The
full reconstruction procedure functions at a 20 Hz refresh rate while
consuming 0.8 mW of power, attaining real-time operation appropriate for
epidermal implementations.

\section{Experiments}\label{experiments}

\subsection{Experimental Setup and
Protocol}\label{experimental-setup-and-protocol}

To assess the proposed bio-inspired SNN framework, we performed
experiments with a bespoke epidermal IMU network comprising six nodes
positioned on the lower limbs (thigh, shank, and foot segments
bilaterally). Each node integrated a 9-axis IMU (BMI160, Bosch
Sensortec) with the hybrid neuromorphic processor described in Section
4.3. The system was compared with three standard fusion techniques: a
complementary filter \cite{ShiZhangLiYuanZhu2023}, an extended Kalman
filter (EKF) \cite{MarinsYunBachmannothers2001}, and a method based on
deep learning employing LSTM networks \cite{GuangGaoLiuLi2021}. All
algorithms processed identical input data streams sampled at 100 Hz.

The evaluation protocol included three movement conditions designed to
test different aspects of fusion performance: 1. \textbf{Slow postural
transitions}: 5-minute sequences of controlled ankle
dorsiflexion/plantarflexion and knee flexion/extension (0.5-1 Hz) to
assess static accuracy 2. \textbf{Dynamic gait cycles}: 10-meter walking
trials at varying speeds (0.8-1.6 m/s) with sudden direction changes to
evaluate dynamic response 3. \textbf{Complex activities}:
Sports-specific movements (lateral shuffles, jump landings) to test
robustness against rapid accelerations

The true orientation was acquired by means of an optical motion capture
system (Vicon MX) equipped with 12 cameras sampling at 200 Hz,
synchronized with the IMU data through hardware triggers. Marker
clusters were positioned next to each IMU node to permit immediate
comparison. The system's adaptive capabilities were further tested by
introducing controlled artifacts: temporary magnetic interference
(neodymium magnet brought within 30 cm of sensors) and mechanical
perturbations (gentle tapping on sensor housings during operation).

\subsection{Performance Metrics}\label{performance-metrics}

Fusion accuracy was measured by calculating four metrics across 1-second
sliding windows.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)} of Euler angles relative to
  optical ground truth: \[
  RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\theta_i - \hat{\theta}_i)^2}
  \tag{19}
  \] where \(\theta_i\) and \(\hat{\theta}_i\) represent estimated and
  reference angles, respectively.
\item
  \textbf{Dynamic Response Index (DRI)}: Correlation between estimated
  and reference angular velocities during rapid movements: \[
  DRI = \frac{\text{cov}(\omega, \hat{\omega})}{\sigma_\omega \sigma_{\hat{\omega}}}
  \tag{20}
  \]
\item
  \textbf{Energy Consumption} : Power consumption was recorded with a
  high-accuracy source-measure instrument (Keysight B2901A) under
  steady-state operating conditions.
\item
  \textbf{Adaptation Latency}: Time required to recover \textless5°
  error after introducing magnetic interference, quantified as the first
  passage time of the error signal.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Comparative Results}\label{comparative-results}

Table 1 presents the overall performance across all movement conditions,
which highlights the SNN framework's benefits in dynamic contexts
alongside its comparable accuracy in static settings.

\textbf{Table 1. Performance comparison across fusion methods}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
Method & RMSE (°) & DRI & Power (mW) & Latency (ms) \\
Complementary Filter & 3.2 & 0.78 & 1.2 & 4200 \\
EKF & 2.1 & 0.85 & 3.8 & 2100 \\
LSTM & 1.9 & 0.88 & 5.1 & 1500 \\
Proposed SNN & 2.3 & 0.92 & 0.8 & 800 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The SNN achieved superior dynamic response (DRI = 0.92) by effectively
reinforcing gyroscopic contributions during rapid movements while
suppressing accelerometer drift. Figure 2 displays this adaptive
weighting in a gait cycle, which indicates how the SNN raised gyroscope
impact during swing phase while depending more on accelerometer
information in stance.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/2.png}
\caption{Dynamic sensor weighting during gait cycle}
\end{figure}

Energy measurements showed the SNN's efficiency advantage, with power
consumption 33\% lower than the complementary filter and 79\% lower than
the EKF. This stems from the event-driven processing architecture, where
only 12-18\% of timesteps required active computation during typical
movements. The hybrid CMOS-organic implementation further reduced static
power by 42\% compared to pure CMOS designs.

\subsection{Robustness Evaluation}\label{robustness-evaluation}

The proposed framework showed notable capability in managing transient
artifacts. When subjected to magnetic interference, the SNN recovered
accurate orientation estimates within 800 ms, 2.6× faster than the EKF
and 5.3× faster than the complementary filter. This rapid adaptation
resulted from the plasticity mechanisms automatically downweighting
magnetometer inputs while reinforcing consistent gyroscope-accelerometer
correlations.

Mechanical disturbances caused short-term misalignment inaccuracies of
8-12° across all approaches, yet the SNN resolved these inaccuracies
40\% more rapidly than other methods by interpreting irregular spike
patterns as noise instead of actual movement. Figure 3 shows the error
trajectories during a representative perturbation event at t=2.1s.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/3.png}
\caption{Orientation error during mechanical perturbation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Ablation Study}\label{ablation-study}

We conducted systematic ablation tests to isolate contributions of key
SNN components by creating three variants: 1. \textbf{Fixed-Threshold
SNN}: Removed adaptive thresholding (Equation 4) 2. \textbf{Non-Plastic
SNN}: Disabled STDP learning (Equation 6) 3. \textbf{Continuous SNN}:
Replaced spiking neurons with rate-coded units

Table 2 summarizes the performance degradation observed in each ablated
condition relative to the full SNN.

\textbf{Table 2. Ablation study results}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Variant & RMSE Increase & DRI Decrease & Power Increase \\
Fixed-Threshold SNN & 38\% & 0.11 & 12\% \\
Non-Plastic SNN & 52\% & 0.15 & 9\% \\
Continuous SNN & 27\% & 0.07 & 63\% \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The findings establish that adaptive thresholding and synaptic
plasticity both play a substantial role in dynamic performance, whereas
event-based spiking yields considerable energy efficiency. The
non-plastic version showed notably inferior results in complex tasks, as
it did not adapt sensor weights correctly across various movement
stages.

\section{Discussion and Future
Work}\label{discussion-and-future-work}

\subsection{Limitations of the Bio-Inspired Adaptive SNN Fusion
Framework}\label{limitations-of-the-bio-inspired-adaptive-snn-fusion-framework}

Although the proposed framework shows notable benefits compared to
traditional fusion approaches, a number of constraints merit
examination. The existing implementation necessitates roughly 30 seconds
of initial motion to achieve consistent synaptic weights, and
orientation estimates may show greater variability (1.5-2× RMSE relative
to stable operation) in this period. This adaptation period stems from
the STDP learning rule's need to accumulate sufficient spike timing
statistics before converging to optimal weights. Moreover, the system
shows reduced accuracy during sustained high-frequency vibrations
(\textgreater15 Hz), as the spiking encoder's refractory period (5 ms)
limits its ability to resolve rapid successive events. These
oscillations sometimes arise in athletic contexts with repeated
collisions, such as bouncing a basketball or jogging on irregular
surfaces.

The hybrid CMOS-organic approach, though mechanically suited to
epidermal substrates, produces minor fluctuations in synaptic
conductance which may influence the uniformity of fusion. Evaluations of
10 manufactured devices showed 8-12\% variability in weight updates from
OECTs, chiefly caused by inconsistencies in the thickness of the
PEDOT:PSS channel. Although the homeostatic regulation mechanism
(Equation 8) compensates for these variations over time, they may
temporarily degrade performance when adding new sensor nodes to an
existing network.

\subsection{Potential Application Scenarios Beyond Human Movement
Analysis}\label{potential-application-scenarios-beyond-human-movement-analysis}

The biologically inspired fusion concepts established in this study may
apply to multiple fields where durable multi-sensor coordination is
needed in changing environments. In soft robotics, the SNN structure
could support independent adjustment to dynamic environmental
interactions, where varied sensor types gain importance based on contact
forces and material deformations \cite{ParkLeeKimSeoGoothers2020}. The
plasticity mechanisms could make robotic skins autonomously prioritize
tactile data in manipulation tasks while giving greater importance to
proprioceptive signals during free motion.

A further encouraging approach focuses on aquatic monitoring systems, in
which the dependability of sensors varies due to water turbulence and
biofouling. The adaptive weighting method could keep precise navigation
in underwater vehicles by choosing dynamically among inertial, magnetic,
and pressure sensors depending on their immediate signal-to-noise ratios
\cite{SheikderZhangChenLiLiuZuoHeothers2025}. This capability would be
particularly valuable in shallow coastal regions where magnetic
disturbances are common.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations in Epidermal Sensor Data
Collection}\label{ethical-considerations-in-epidermal-sensor-data-collection}

As wireless epidermal networks become more sophisticated, they raise
important ethical questions regarding continuous biometric monitoring.
The event-driven architecture of our system introduces distinct privacy
concerns, as although it decreases total data transfer, the irregular
spike patterns could contain sensitive motion identifiers (e.g., gait
irregularities suggesting neurological disorders) \cite{PaulIrvine2014}.
Upcoming versions ought to include anonymization methods on the device,
which keep the usefulness of movement analysis intact but stop the
connection to identities.

The self-adjusting ability also requires thorough verification to
guarantee impartiality of algorithms among varied user groups. Initial
assessments showed minor discrepancies in fusion precision across age
cohorts (2.1° RMSE for younger individuals compared to 2.8° for older
subjects), probably attributable to variations in motion velocity and
fluidity. These differences underscore the necessity for training
protocols designed to address diversity in demographic-based natural
movement variations \cite{Matthew2024}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

The bio-inspired spiking neural network architecture presented in this
work establishes the viability of adaptive sensor fusion for wireless
epidermal IMU networks and overcomes key drawbacks of traditional static
fusion approaches. The system attains robust orientation estimation by
employing event-based encoding, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and
hybrid neuromorphic hardware, operating within the strict power and form
factor limitations of wearable applications. The framework's capacity to
independently modify sensor weights according to movement dynamics and
environmental conditions removes the necessity for manual calibration,
which renders it especially appropriate for real-world deployment
situations characterized by unpredictable variations in sensor
reliability.

Experimental results substantiate the architecture's benefits, which
comprise outstanding dynamic response, swift adjustment to transient
artifacts, and notable energy efficiency relative to conventional fusion
methods. The hybrid CMOS-organic design achieves mechanical harmony with
epidermal substrates without compromising computational accuracy,
thereby connecting biological signal processing concepts with real-world
wearable applications. The event-driven compression mechanism improves
efficiency and lowers wireless bandwidth demands while preserving
accuracy.

Future research directions include extending the plasticity mechanisms
to accommodate multi-node synchronization in full-body sensor networks
and exploring federated learning approaches to improve generalization
across diverse user populations. Moreover, the combination of the
framework with novel flexible energy harvesting technologies could make
fully autonomous operation possible, further expanding the prospects of
epidermal sensor networks for prolonged movement observation. The
proposed architecture not only advances the state-of-the-art in
neuromorphic edge computing but also establishes a foundation for
next-generation wearable systems capable of seamless adaptation to
complex real-world conditions.
